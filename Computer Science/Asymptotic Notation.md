# Complexity Analysis
Asymptotic notation is a method used to analyze and describe the efficiency of algorithms by abstractly estimating their time and space requirements. It provides a way to understand how the performance of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. By using asymptotic notation, we can focus on the growth rate of the algorithm's resource usage rather than the exact values. This allows us to make general statements about the efficiency of an algorithm without getting bogged down in specific implementation details or hardware considerations.
