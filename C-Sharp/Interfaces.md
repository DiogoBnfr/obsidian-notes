Is a construct that defines a contract or a set of members that a class must implement. It acts as a blueprint for classes and provides a way to define common behavior without specifying the implementation details.

# Defining an Interface
To define an interface in C#, you use the *interface* keyword followed by the interface name. For example:

```csharp
public interface IShape 
{     
	void Draw();     
	double CalculateArea(); 
}
```

In this example, *IShape* is an interface that defines two members: *Draw()* and *CalculateArea()*. Interfaces can include methods, properties, indexers, and events.
 
# Implementing an Interface
To implement an interface, a class must use the *implements* keyword and provide an implementation for all the members defined in the interface. For example:

```csharp
public class Circle : IShape 
{     
	public void Draw()     
	{         
		// Implementation of the Draw method for Circle     
	}      
	
	public double CalculateArea()     
	{         
		// Implementation of the CalculateArea method for Circle 
		return Math.PI * radius * radius;     
	} 
}
```

In this example, the *Circle* class implements the *IShape* interface by providing the required implementation for the *Draw()* and *CalculateArea()* methods.

# Using Interfaces
Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and polymorphism in C#. They allow objects of different classes to be treated uniformly if they implement the same interface. For example:

```csharp
public void DrawShapes(IShape[] shapes) 
{     
	foreach (IShape shape in shapes)     
	{         
		shape.Draw();     
	} 
}
```

In this example, the *DrawShapes()* method takes an array of *IShape* objects as a parameter. It can accept any object that implements the *IShape* interface. Inside the method, the *Draw*() method is called on each object, regardless of its specific class.

# Interface Inheritance
Interfaces can also inherit from other interfaces, allowing you to create a hierarchy of interfaces. A class implementing an interface that inherits from another interface must provide implementations for all the members in both interfaces. For example:

```csharp
public interface IResizableShape : IShape 
{     
	void Resize(double scaleFactor); 
}
```

In this example, the *IResizableShape* interface inherits from the *IShape* interface and adds an additional method *Resize()*. A class that implements *IResizableShape* must provide implementations for both *Draw()* and *CalculateArea()* from *IShape* and *Resize()* from *IResizableShape*.
