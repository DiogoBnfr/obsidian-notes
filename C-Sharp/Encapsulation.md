Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming (OOP) that combines data and the methods that manipulate that data into a single unit called a class. It involves bundling related data and behavior together and hiding the internal details of an object from the outside world. Encapsulation provides the following key concepts:

1. **Data Hiding**: Encapsulation hides the internal state and implementation details of an object from direct access by external code. The data members of a class are typically declared as private or protected, restricting direct access from outside the class.
2. **Information Protection**: By encapsulating data within a class, you can define rules and validations for accessing and modifying that data. This protects the integrity and consistency of the data, preventing unauthorized or invalid operations.
3. **Abstraction**: Encapsulation allows you to present a simplified and abstracted view of an object's functionality to the outside world. The public methods and properties of a class provide a well-defined interface that specifies how the object can be interacted with, while hiding the implementation details.
4. **Code Organization**: Encapsulation promotes code organization by grouping related data and behavior together within a class. This improves the readability, maintainability, and understandability of the codebase.

Encapsulation is often achieved by declaring the data members of a class as private and providing public methods (getters and setters) or properties to access and modify the data. The public methods or properties act as a controlled interface to manipulate the internal state of the object, ensuring that data is accessed and modified according to defined rules and validations.

# Access Modifiers
1. **Private:** when a member (such as a method, field, or property) is declared as "private," it can only be accessed and called within the same class where it is declared. It is not accessible from outside the class, including other classes within the same project or assembly.
2. **Internal:** the "internal" access modifier allows access to a member or type within the same project or assembly. It means that the member can be accessed from anywhere within the project/assembly, regardless of the class. However, it is not accessible from outside the project or assembly.
3. **Public:** when a member is declared as "public," it can be accessed and called from anywhere in the codebase, including outside the class, outside the project, and even from different assemblies. It provides the broadest level of accessibility, allowing unrestricted access to the member.
4. **Protected**: When a member is declared as "protected," it can be accessed and called from within the same class and from derived classes. It provides a level of accessibility that allows inherited classes to access and utilize the member.
5. **Private Protected**: The "private protected" access modifier is a combination of the "private" and "protected" access modifiers. It allows access to a member or type within the same assembly (project or DLL) and from derived classes that are in the same assembly. 
6. **Protected Internal**: The "protected internal" access modifier combines the behavior of both "protected" and "internal" access modifiers. It allows access to a member or type from within the same assembly (project or DLL) as well as from derived classes, regardless of whether they are in the same or different assemblies.
